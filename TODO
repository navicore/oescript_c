bugs!
- Iterator_free is not always called, make arena support make sense

txns
- sub txns!
- settings for txn cleanup
  - keep rolled back txns dur setting
  - keep committed txns dur setting
  - allow rollback committed txns setting
      fail the rollingback of a committed txn if
      it can't be 100% reset setting (maybe a put
      item has been 'take'en by someone after the
      commit...

android
- mpio
- ssl

lang support
X make a generalized yield/resume coroutine impl for lua and the dsl and others
X coroutines:
  - bring back lua w/coroutines
  - perl coro
  - python
  - guile continuations
o OeScript DSL (both a wire protocol and a service impl lang)
  - prologee put vars referencing get results
  - enclosed in txn
  - custom result template to contain lease and txn ids from batches?
  - cons car cdr
  - program executes sequentially, if you want concurrent, send batches of sep progs
  - coder notes:
    - ADT
    - arena
    - move scratch stuff into OeScrMsgFactory (name?)
    - the 'next' call should return a msg plus indicate the vars its exec should resolve.  the invokehandler should know how to pull the var data from the result and call a method on oescr to set the vars.  ugh!

networking
X messagepack!?
- ssl
- http
- seda throttle in dispatcher.  blocking always deadlocks us so maybe the only
  throttle is in the readable from the nio but all stages can feed decision in
  the signalhandler? reasearch, what do others do??
- seda throttle in tdispatcher
- redhat queuing??

misc
- get rid of oe_scalar
- oepam loginmodule
  - conversation function (sync initially, don't go to client)
  - conversation function (is async possible??, we can't block for @#$!ing pam but
  we can fail a connection request with the prompt from pam to drive the user in
  the next try)
- 'pam module' to send msg specs to 'oepam module'
- read/take by lease id
- put with no attrs
- refactor OEK so there is just put/get/sta/upl/upt call?
- persist timer dispatcher
- replace all strcmp with strncmp
- replace all strcpy with strncpy
- fix all gcc warnings
- what happens when you commit a txn and some of the enlisted items have expired?

extents
- the netspec string must have extentname on end after port
- multiple extents in one server? w/ txn coordination?
- dynamic extent creation on connection
- dynamic extent lease

oecloud
- distributed store
- use wrappers with directories and oetxns to do async stuff on behalf
  of users async and only commit the first found item the cluster
  presents

Metasaurus
- load metasaurus materials raw with type and id map keys
- process records to create index record maps pointing to lease of orig (need use cases for queries)... possibly process write and take with exits or a service waiting for next sequential ID (but that wouldn't be a lease)
  ...or...
- take the write lease id and put it in a field for immedieate successive idx writes,
and when you edit it, use the lease id to remove and replace idx entries
