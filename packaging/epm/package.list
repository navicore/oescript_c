#note this is untested and almost certainly broken.  it is intended
# to become the config for 'epm' to generate tarballs, rpms, etc...
# for various pkg mgr targets like apt, rpm, yum, osx, ...
#
# note, we also intend to support gentoo/portage and freebsd/ports
# ... and maybe a windows installer.
